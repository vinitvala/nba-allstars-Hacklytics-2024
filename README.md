It is no secret that the NBA All-Star team selection process is often the subject of much debate and controversy.
But what if we had a tool to analyze each player's selection and streamline the process to reduce controversy in the game?

We can provide an unbiased analysis of player performances, backed by comprehensive data. This can help to minimize the number of controversial selections and ensure that the most deserving players are recognized for their hard work and talent. Even though our project is a prototype that only considers 10 players, it can be expanded to a greater extent

You can enter 2 different players in their respective input fields, with the help of a responsive dropdown menu. Once you select them, and click the "compare" button, some of their stats will load in charts at the bottom.
